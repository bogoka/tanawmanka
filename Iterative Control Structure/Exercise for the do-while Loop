/*The goals scored in a soccer match may be inputted as a sequence of 1s and 2s terminated by 0. The number 1 would mean that team 1 made a goal and 2 would mean that team 2 made a goal. Thus the sequence 1 2 1 2 1 1 2 0 means that Team 1 made 4 goals and team 2 made 3 goals in all. Write a program that would input such sequence and output how many goals each team made and the result of the match (“Team 1 won!”, ”Team 2 won!”, “Both tied!”). Ensure that inputs are 0,1 and 2 only.*/
